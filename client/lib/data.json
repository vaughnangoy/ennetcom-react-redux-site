	"faqs" : {
		"list" : [
			{"question" : "What is the difference between a Ennetcom BlackBerry® and other BlackBerry® devices?", "answer": "<p>The first difference is the fact that we supply BlackBerry® devices managed within a BES infrastructure. This is by standard the most secure platform to start with. Other companies offer solutions in a BIS or BES express platform. They cannot guarantee that handsets are protected against third party applications.</p><p>We show you what information is visible on the server. Most companies talk about offshore servers which are secured, but you don’t see with your own eyes what the administrators see on the servers. We give you access to the servers and you will see that our infrastructure is built on true security and that no-one, not even the server administrators can see any information going through the network.</p><p>Our solution is built on S/MIME MEG, which means that also attachments in the mails are encrypted. Other solutions don’t have that possibility. This means that our Ennetcom BlackBerry® devices can send email with attachments like files and pictures fully encrypted.</p><p>A common used platform is PGP encryption on BlackBerry®. This platform does NOT have a third party encrypted layer. It is based only on the Blackberry BES or BES Express platform. In other words, real guaranteed anonymous protection is not possible as the RIM platform runs the key management. Our system is built by encryption methods supplied by different developing companies. We can therefore guarantee true encryption because it is multi-layered. Encryption technologies from different developers combined and are added to one another.</p>"},
			{"question" : "What encryptions are being used for the Ennetcom BlackBerry® devices?", "answer": "<p>The hybrid message encryption uses AES 256 and RSA 1024. These are well known standards for unbreakable encryption. The combination of these 2 encryption standards is used in our S/MIME MEG encrypted Mobile Security Platform. This complete security platform runs on top of the BlackBerry® Enterprise Server which, by itself, is also encrypted by S/MIME MEG. This multi-layered encryption is infinitely strong which makes it impossible to decrypt a message using any type of attack (brute force attack and/or any other).</p>"},
			{"question" : "Can all BlackBerry® models be used for this platform?", "answer": "<p>Any BlackBerry® that is running on OS-5 and higher can be used for our services. You can bring your own BlackBerry® and we can connect it to our server. However, after programming your BlackBerry®, it can only be used for secure communication and cannot communicate to any other device that is not running on our platform.</p>"},
			{"question" : "What SIM cards can be used for this Encrypted Infrastructure and what are the costs?", "answer": "<p>Our solution is built on a BlackBerry® BES infrastructure. This means that only BES SIM cards can be used. As a company you can ask your operator for BES sim cards which can then be provided to you. For consumers we offer Post-Paid BES SIM cards. For one hundred Euro per month we have a global roaming plan available. This means you will never have to top up your credit and the BlackBerry® device will work anywhere in the world.</p>"},
			{"question" : "Can you give me some examples of the costs for the Encrypted BlackBerry® Solution?", "answer": "<p>No, it is not possible to give price examples as every solution has its own inventory of needs (requirements). Please $1 if you have any specific questions.</p>", "replace" : {"$1" : "<a href=\"https://www.ennetcom.com/contact-2/\">contact us</a>"}}
